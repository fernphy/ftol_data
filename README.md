Home of [Fern Tree of Life (FTOL)](https://fernphy.github.io) phylogeny and associated data files.

The data in this repo are automatically generated by the `ftol` repo (https://github.com/fernphy/ftol).

These files should not be edited by hand. Rather, the [`snapshot_ftol_data.R`](https://github.com/fernphy/ftol/blob/main/R/snapshot_ftol_data.R) script should be run to commit changes and automatically push to the [remote repository](https://github.com/fernphy/ftol_data).
