Home of [Fern Tree of Life (FTOL)](https://fernphy.github.io) phylogeny and associated data files.

The data in this repo are automatically generated by the `ftol` repo (https://github.com/fernphy/ftol).

These files should not be edited by hand. Rather, the [`snapshot_ftol_data.R`](https://github.com/fernphy/ftol/blob/main/R/snapshot_ftol_data.R) script should be run to commit changes and automatically push to the [remote repository](https://github.com/fernphy/ftol_data).

For more information, please see the accompanying paper:

## Data format

For information about data files, see [ftol_data_README.txt](ftol_data_README.txt).

## Commit messages

The commit messages in this repo have a special format. They have three parts: `code`, `data`, and `docker`. Each is followed by an equals sign and a string.

- For `code`, the string is a commit hash in the [ftol](https://github.com/fernphy/ftol) repo.
- For `data`, the string is the DOI for the archive containing the __input__ data.
- The `docker`, the string is the docker image used to run the code. 

Together, these specify the version of code, input data, and computing environment used to generate a given data file.

For example, [files with the commit](https://github.com/fernphy/ftol_data/commit/7121a199b02e906afcda1827b7eca7c06b1ba692)

```
code=df94ab228980259a3e6e8830b24cba401f484dfe
data=10.6084/m9.figshare.19474316.v1
docker=joelnitta/ftol:1.0.0
```

were generated by [this code](https://github.com/fernphy/ftol/tree/df94ab228980259a3e6e8830b24cba401f484dfe) using [this input data](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19474316.v1) in [this docker containter](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ftol/joelnitta/ftol/1.0.0/images/sha256-a35dded83baf63a23d2da8ff082b263ecf0b96b06052fc705debfe93ad00d408?context=explore).

Note that `code` commit hashes correspond to the **earliest** (oldest) commit in [ftol](https://github.com/fernphy/ftol) that generates that file; more recent commits that don't result in a change to the file will not show up as a new commit here.

## ftolr R package

These data are also available via the [ftolr](https://github.com/fernphy/ftolr) R package, which allows direct loading into R and more options for subsetting and formatting.
